                                in our urban and suburban houses what should we do without cats? in our sitting or bedrooms, our libraries, in our kitchens and storerooms, our farms, barns and rickyards, in our docks, our quaries, our ships, and our wharves, in our corn markets, meat markets, and other places too numerous to mention, how usefull they are! ln our ships, however, the rats often set them at defiance; still they are of real service.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                How wonderfully patient is the cat When watching for rats or mice, awaiting their egress from their place of refuge or that which is their home! How will shakespeare in Pericles, act iii., discribe this keen attention of the cat to its natural persuit!
                            </p>
                            <p class="space">
                                the cat, with eyne lf burning coal, Now crouches frorm (before) the mouse's hole.

                                A slight rustle, and the fugitive cornes forth a quick, sharp, resolute motion, and the cat has poved its usefulness. Let any one have a plague of rats and mice, as i once had, and i'll let them be delivered therefrom by cats, as i was, and they will have a lasting and kind regard for them.
